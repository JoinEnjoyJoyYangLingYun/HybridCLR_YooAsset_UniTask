        // In computer science, a semaphore is a variable or abstract data type used to control access to a common resource by multiple processes in a concurrent
        // system such as a multitasking operating system. A semaphore is simply a variable. This variable is used to solve critical section problems and to achieve
        // process synchronization in the multi processing environment. A trivial semaphore is a plain variable that is changed (for example, incremented or
        // decremented, or toggled) depending on programmer-defined conditions.
        //
        // A useful way to think of a semaphore as used in the real-world system is as a record of how many units of a particular resource are available, coupled with
        // operations to adjust that record safely (i.e. to avoid race conditions) as units are required or become free, and, if necessary, wait until a unit of the
        // resource becomes available.
