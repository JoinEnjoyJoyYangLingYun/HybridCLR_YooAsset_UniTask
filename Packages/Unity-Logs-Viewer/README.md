# Unity-Logs-Viewer


Please note with new unity you can view device logs on editor console window, check the new attach menu in editor console window.


Using this tool you can easily check your editor console logs inside the game itself! 
All what you have to do is to make a circle gesture using your mouse (click and drag) or your finger (touch and drag) on the mobile screen to show all these logs! 

You can download also from unity asset store

    1 - create reporter from menu (Reporter->Create) at first scene your game start.
    2 - then set the ” Scrip execution order ” in (Edit -> Project Settings ) of Reporter.cs to be the highest.
